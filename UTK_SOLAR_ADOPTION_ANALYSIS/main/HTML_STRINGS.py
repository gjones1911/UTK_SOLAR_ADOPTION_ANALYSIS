<h1 style=color:lightgreen>UTK & CURENT Regional Solar Analysis</h1>\
<p><h2>Purpose:</h2>\
    <p>The goal of the research was to analyze sociological, geographic, policy, population and habit based factors " \
      "related to solar adoption using roof top solar installation counts and sizes found in the Deep Solar Data set " \
      "provided by Stanford <strong>(CITATION NEEDED)</strong>. An exploratory analysis of possible regional " \
      "differences in the most influential factors as well as what solar attributes can possibly be uses as an unbiased " \
      "solar adoption/diffusion metric. Heat Maps were generated various solar adoption metric levels across 7 states " \
      " (AL, GA, KY, MS, NC, TN, VA) visualizing various solar metric concentrations at the census tract level." \
